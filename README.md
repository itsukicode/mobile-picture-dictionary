# Mobile Picture Dictionary
This is an application that you can search and save the definition of the word by a picture, which helps me to memorize English vocabulary effectively.\
This is mobile version of [picture dictionary](https://github.com/tommytommychopper/picture-dictionary) that I created previously.
